Mid-January, Mike and I talking by the fire, our lovely dog, Luna, at our feet.
I had just found out that the one-ingredient treats I was so proud to have discovered were dangerous.
[In fact, they were the cause of kidney failure in at least one local Nelson dog.](https://www.nelsonstar.com/news/nelson-pet-owners-warned-about-dog-treats/)
The article I stumbled upon in the Nelson Star was from 2016. How could I not have known? Luna seemed fine — she's a large dog and I hadn't been feeding them to her for long. 
Comments after the article  suggested that the dear dog's human shouldn't have trusted treats made in China and instead should buy Canadian treats. 
That got me thinking. 

### Locally Sourced & Made

What I love about Nelson and environs is that there are a ton of earnest, keen locals who want a vibrant local economy — and instead of dreaming about it they get their hands dirty and build it.

Our area has not one but several local breweries. Not one but a few local coffee roasters. We've got a slew of local farmers, sewists, artists — Why not dog treat makers?

Which is what I proposed to Mike.

He countered with his new passion: upcycled gear.

We got to work.

### One Ingredient? Or 3

Our house was soon humming with the sound of my ancient (wedding present) sewing machine and various kitchen appliances whirring.

We were making and testing dog treats and treat pouches, dear dog Luna a little confused but also happy with the energy, smells, and joy in the air.

Dozens for recipes tested: Often, the ingredients used were convenient for humans but not necessarily the healthiest for the dogs. Could I make treats that were super healthy and delicious for dogs while still being convenient (sturdy and low odor) for humans?

Taking notes, researching what dogs need and love to eat, trying mini experiments and making new notes, a few takeaways became clear.

### Good But Not Good Enough

A combination of meat, oat flour, and chia seeds baked in a particular way at both high and low heat, with ingredients added in a particular manner seemed to do the trick.

 The chia and meat are a good combination as the omega fats in each balance the other out. The oat flour was a compromise. Healthier than wheat (as far as my research could tell) with good b vitamins and low gluten.

I was pretty satisfied. 

Mike was sewing away, using old jeans, old Carharts, old anything durable to make a treat pouch that would also serve as the container for our treats. A dog "growler" began to take shape...

### Upcycled Growlers and...

Mike and I laughed at the idea of a dog "growler" — What a lovely way to encourage less packaging, we thought. 

Growlers...like the glass jugs we refill with beer...

Beer — Mike and I looked at each other, thinking the same thing. Spent Grain!

In the three decades that I have been a brewer's wife, I have been witness to the symbiotic relationship brewers have with local farmers. The spent grain is used as animal feed, keeping it out of the landfill. 

It's healthy for livestock. But what about dogs?

[As it turns out, spent barley is super healthy for dogs!](./nutrition) 

Back to the kitchen, where I spent many more hours replacing the oat flour with spent grain. After many notes, many hours, and many, many iterations, I was happy.

### Spent Grain Bags ...

Witnessing my excitement with the spent grain, Mike brought home a few grain bags. After many more hours, he came up with a dog treat pouch that used the grain bags — a perfect upcycled dog growler for upcycled dog treats!

### Taste Testing!

We decided to see what the dogs thought :) and started to pass them out to Luna's friends. The response was overjoyed dogs :) Even the dogs that politely spat out other treats happily ate these. 

### A Perfectly Imperfect Company 

I made a crude website and made more treats.

Here, a small confession. They weren't quite what I remembered. Same ingredients, same time baking, same time spent cooling. And yet — they seemed more fragile. Crumbly...

The dogs loved them; they lasted for quite a long time. I figured I may be misremembering...

I was completely immersed in website building at this point. The little site I made really wasn't good enough. I needed to make a site that could be the face of Updog Treats — and, with a budget of $0, this was a bit of a feat. Happily, as of — well, as of today, March 21, 2023, I feel satisfied. It's not perfect, but it's good enough.

And the treats?

Well, here's what happened: My notes failed to include a very important step that is crucial in making sure that the treats are sufficiently crunchy and stable as well as being delicious and healthy. After many more hours, I finally remembered that little hack for my first successful batch. I rebaked the most recent batch of treats and we officially have 9 bags left to sell :) 

### Updog — Up, Up, and Away :)

Mike and I very humbly want to join the leagues of earnest, keen Nelsonites who contribute a little bit of good to our dear community while reducing the bad we put out. In our case, we want to offer local dog treats and gear that keep stuff out of the landfill, add to the burgeoning list of locally made products, and, well, bring a little joy to our community. 

We have carefully priced our treats to be slightly less expensive than Yappitizers and Crumps Naturals, both excellent choices and Canadian made (Yappitizers is British Columbian and Crumps Naturals is from Ontario).

### Feedback Welcome

We're just starting out and are happy to hear from you. Look for us on Instagram @updogtreats or out on the trails where we walk Luna at least twice a day!

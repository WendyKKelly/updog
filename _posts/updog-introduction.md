Our dog Luna's best friend is a lovely Bernese Mountain dog named Dallas. Dallas and Luna often walk together, meeting friends along the way, stopping for treats from the various human companions as they explore our gorgeous surroundings.

Watching the dogs sit to the best of their ability for treats as we pry them from our pockets, their tails moving, eyes intent on the hand of the human procuring the treat — I noticed two things.

First, there are dogs who will eat literally anything that hand produces :) and dogs who are extremely discerning. 

Second, treats-in-pockets gets annoying, fast. A couple friends had cute treat bags that resembled that bags rock climbers carry their chalk in, and I couldn't help but think that was a genius device.

For a brief moment over this winter, I tried to not buy plastics.
I found some wonderful resources, including the [Zero Waste Store](https://zerowastestore.com/) and [Plastic Free July.](https://www.earthday.org/plastic-free-july-toolkit/).
But the problem of plastics is deep and wide and not a clear path to a good ending where everyone rides off into the sunset, victorious.
Take the Zero Waste Store. It reeks of privilege â€” the message I got is that I can buy my way to a guilt free pass. And, really, when I say privilege, the bar is low: the little hair care kit costs a reasonable $51.99 and includes a really nice brush, a cute soap dish, shampoo, conditioner, and an interesting loofah wrapped in a net bag that looks handmade.
